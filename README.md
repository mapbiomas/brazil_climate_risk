5. Water Security Index
   - The final integrated climate risk assessment incorporates the Water Security Index (ISH – Índice de Segurança Hídrica), a composite indicator developed by the Brazilian National Water Agency (ANA). The ISH reflects dimensions such as:
      - Water availability
      - Infrastructure and supply capacity
      -  Socioeconomic demand pressure
      - Environmental and climate vulnerabilities
   - This index allows the identification of regions with structural weaknesses in water security. In the current methodology, areas with low ISH values were flagged as more vulnerable, especially when intersecting with zones of high susceptibility to landslides or flooding.
 The dataset is accessible through the SNIRH metadata platform:
